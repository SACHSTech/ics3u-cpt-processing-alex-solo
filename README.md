# Space Dodgers

The objective of the game is to play as a spaceship where you can control with the keys WASD. One thing to know are that the up, down, left and right keys will not work, so please use the WASD keys! You have to avoid the bullets that are coming from the right side of the screen using the keys. If you can survive with the three hit points that are given to you for 15 rounds, then you will have won the game. Losing the three lives before that point will mean you have lost the game. Along with the bullets that you will have to dodge, there will be additional items that will also appear. They can benefit you with an increase of movespeed of your ship, or be a detrement by slowing down your ship and making it harder for you to dodge. If you want the effects of the items, simply get hit by the projectile of the item. When you start the program there will also be a main menu where you will be able to choose the colours avaliable for your ship and to start the game when you want. There will also be a secret item that will appear in the shape of a star. If you get three stars and make it to round 15, there will be a special ending. If you lose or win the round, you can simply reset the program to play again. I hope you will have fun playing my game!
